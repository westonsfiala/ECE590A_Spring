Pinball - A game where the player moves around a red ball at the bottom of the screen to prevent a bluegreen ball that moves vertically from reaching the bottom of the screen.
The player is able to move the red ball by tilting the screen around the x axis. When the phone's accelerometer has readings on the x axis it will move the ball towards that acceleration.
